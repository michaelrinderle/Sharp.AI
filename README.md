## Semantic Kernel Wrapper for AI Functions
A lightweight, easy-to-use C# library that wraps Semantic Kernel to provide streamlined access to AI functionalitiesâ€”such as chatbots, voicebots, and more. This library simplifies the integration of AI capabilities into your .NET applications, enabling rapid development and deployment of intelligent agents.

## Features
- Unified API: Access multiple AI functions (chatbots, voicebots, etc.) through a consistent interface.
- Extensible Design: Easily add support for additional AI capabilities as they become available.
- Built for .NET: Leverages the power of Semantic Kernel and integrates seamlessly with your C# projects.

# Supported AI Models:
- OpenAI Api
- Azure OpenApi
- Local Ollama

## Coming Soon:
- Desktop Applications: Full support for computer-based AI integrations.
- Browser Integrations: Tools and wrappers for web-based AI applications.
- Online Searching: Allow AI to search internet for answers.
- Deep Research: Create reports with deep research and citation linking.

## Roadmap

### Short-Term:
- Stabilize current implementation
- Expand support for additional AI functions (e.g., image generation, document summarization).
- Improve error handling and logging.

### Mid-Term:
- Implement robust support for desktop (computer) applications.
- Launch browser integration modules.
- Memory Modules / Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Long-Term:
- Enhance customization options for memory management and context control.
- Support multi-modal interactions (voice, text, and video).
